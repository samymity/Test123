Science experiments testing the effectiveness of soap and hand sanitizer on different substances like sand, dirt, and black pepper can help us understand how well these products clean and sanitize our hands.
The experiments suggest that both soap and hand sanitizer are effective at reducing the risk of germ transmission.  Soap may be more effective at removing dirt and debris from the skin. When it comes to removing bacteria\small particles, hand sanitizer may be the more effective option.This is because hand sanitizer contains alcohol, which can dissolve the oils and fats, making it easier to remove.

One experiment could involve putting a small amount of sand, dirt, or black pepper on a glass dish and then applying soap or hand sanitizer, this will  simulate the process of cleaning your hands. Afterward, you can see how much of the thing/bacteria
Another experiment could involve using a microscope to examine how well soap and hand sanitizer remove bacteria from different substances. This could involve placing a small amount of bacteria on a surface and then applying soap or hand sanitizer. After a set amount of time, the surface could be examined under a microscope to determine how much bacteria was removed.
The results of these experiments could help us understand how effective soap and hand sanitizer are at cleaning and sanitizing our hands, especially when dealing with substances like sand, dirt, and black pepper. It is important to note that both soap and hand sanitizer are effective at killing germs and preventing the spread of infection, but soap is generally considered the better option for removing dirt and other substances from the skin.
